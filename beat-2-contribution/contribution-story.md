# Contribution: Improve Radio and RadioCard Accessibility

Path: `beat-2-contribution/contribution-story.md`

This file is Assignment 5, and it is graded at the path above; a copy kept anywhere else in
the repository is not read. **Keep every section header below under its exact name** — the
format criteria grade exactly that. Your course repo link is the whole submission: no tool
files and no evidence uploads are part of Assignment 5.

**Contribution Number:** [1]
**Student:** Aryan Namboodiri
**GitHub Username:** Aryankn29
**Issue:** https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/issues/7983 (also https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/issues/7982)
**Pull Request:** Pending

One repository, built across units 5 to 8, telling the whole story of your real
contribution. Fill it as you work, not at the end — the sections below ask for evidence that
is far easier to write down as it happens than to reconstruct in the last weekend.

Contribution Number stays `[1]` unless you make more than one contribution this term; it
just numbers them.

## Toolkit

Every story section below, from Why I Chose This Issue through Pull
Request, ends with a Toolkit block: which tool did that phase's work
and how you used it, what it produced, what difficulties or
shortcomings it presented, and what you changed or would change
because of them. Together the blocks are the thread the rubric's
Toolkit points read, and they are the raw material for your unit-9
portfolio, so keep them current as you work rather than
reconstructing them later.

A Toolkit block looks like this (copy it into each story section and
fill it there):

```text
**Toolkit**

- Tool: [which tool did this phase's work, and how you used it]
- What it produced: [described in a sentence or a short excerpt]
- Difficulties: [what fought you or fell short, or "none met"]
- What changed: [the patch, revision, or workaround, what you would
  update, or "nothing"]
```

This section also keeps one short dated entry per week of tool work,
starting below: what you built or changed that week, what broke, and
what you changed because of it. The blocks tell the story where it
happened; these entries are the toolkit's own timeline.

All four entries are graded. Keep every heading below, and fill each
one in the week it belongs to.

**Unit 5: Building and testing issue-scout (November 3–4, 2026)**

[2-4 sentences: what you built (the scout, your strategy), what broke
or fell short, what changed because of it.]

I adapted my existing issue-selection skill into `issue-scout` and developed a strategy for finding manageable, testable open-source contributions. Initial scans surfaced issues that were already claimed, stale, or fixed by existing PRs, so I refined the selection process to verify issue discussions, competing PRs, and current source code. After narrowing the search to recent issues, I used the scout to evaluate five finalists and selected Yamada UI #7983 and #7982 because they appeared unclaimed, shared a likely root cause, and matched my TypeScript and React experience.

**Unit 6: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the voice-guard, the repo-memory file. What broke or
fell short, and what changed because of it. "Nothing broke" counts when
it is true - say how you know.]

**Unit 7: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the ship-gate and your gate manifest. What it produced
on your real branch, what fought you, what changed because of it.]

**Unit 8: [one line on the tool work]**

[2-4 sentences: the PR-monitor and your playbook. What it read, what it
drafted, what you did with the draft.]

## Why I Chose This Issue

[1-2 paragraphs in your own words: how you searched, what your scan
surfaced, what your scout's verdict said, why this issue fits your
profile, and what you hope to learn. If your scout's verdict on it
was reject and you chose it anyway, say so here and say why; choosing
against your own tool silently is what loses points. Close with an
honest read of the tool itself: where the scout fell short on a real
wild search and what you changed or would change, or what convinced
you it held up. **Record the link to your claim comment in this section too.**
Not claimed yet? Write `claim pending` and today's date where the link goes,
and add the link the moment your claim lands.]

I searched for recent good-first-issue contributions that matched my skills and could realistically be completed within the capstone timeline. My initial searches surfaced several promising issues, but further investigation revealed competing contributors or fixes already implemented. I narrowed the search to newer issues and ran my scout against five finalists, all of which passed its rubric. I selected Yamada UI's Radio #7983 and RadioCard #7982 because they appear to share an accessibility bug involving `aria-readonly`, potentially allowing one focused fix with regression tests for both components.

I wanted to contribute to a maintained React component library while improving my understanding of accessibility testing. The scouting process showed that an open issue is not necessarily unfinished, so verifying current code and PR history became an important part of my selection strategy.

**Claim comments:**

- [Radio #7983](https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/issues/7983#issuecomment-6624567860)
- [RadioCard #7982](https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/issues/7982#issuecomment-6624577538)

**Toolkit**

- Tool: `issue-scout`, a Claude Code skill using my search strategy and six-check rubric to evaluate GitHub issues.
- What it produced: Initial scans and evaluations of five finalists, including accepted verdicts for both selected Yamada UI issues and identification of their likely shared root cause.
- Difficulties: Initial results included claimed issues, stale listings, and bugs already addressed by existing or unlinked PRs.
- What changed: I refined my search strategy to prioritize recent issues and verify contributor activity, PR history, and current source code before making a selection.

## Reproduction Process

**Environment Setup**

[What a stranger would need to stand this up: your operating system,
the relevant versions (language, runtime, package manager, the project
itself), and how you set the project up. Then the challenges you faced
and how you solved them, or that none came up.]

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Observed result]

**Reproduction Evidence**

- **Commit showing reproduction:** [link to commit in your fork]
- **Screenshots/logs:** [if applicable]
- **My findings:** [what you discovered during reproduction; an
  honest, evidenced cannot-reproduce that led you to re-pick or ask
  the maintainer belongs here and costs you nothing]

## Solution Approach

**Analysis**

[Your analysis of the root cause: what is causing the issue, traced
to the files and functions involved.]

**Proposed Solution**

[High-level description of your fix approach, and what you are
deliberately NOT changing.]

**Implementation Plan**

1. [Modify file X to do Y]
2. [Add or change Z]
3. [Update tests]

[Record deviations here as they happen: what changed mid-build and
why. A recorded deviation is honest work; silent drift is not.]

## Testing Strategy

[What observable checks prove the fix: your reproduction steps re-run
against the built change (before and after), and the repo's own test
suite or checks with the outcome shown. "Tests pass" with nothing
observable named is not a strategy.]

## Pull Request

**PR Link:** [GitHub PR URL when opened]

**PR Description:** [what the PR says; much of the content above
adapts into it]

**Maintainer Feedback:**

- [Date]: [feedback received, or "none yet"; silence is a normal
  state and costs you nothing]
- [Date]: [how you addressed it]

**Status:** [Awaiting review / Iterating / Merged / Closed. The
status is a fact you record, never a grade: the PR is graded as
opened.]

## Resources Used

[What actually helped, not a reading list. List things this story
already shows you using: the doc you followed to set the environment
up, the thread that explained the bug, the person who answered you.
One real entry beats ten plausible ones.]

- [Discussion, issue, or post that helped]
