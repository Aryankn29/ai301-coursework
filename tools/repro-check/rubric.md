# Rubric: is this reproduction package ready to post?

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE. The skill in SKILL.md executes whatever
checks you define here. It ships empty on purpose: the judgment is your
work.

A filled rubric must contain:

1. At least one row in the checks table. Each row needs all four
   columns:
   - Check: a short name (used in the output JSON).
   - Evidence: exactly what to look at, and where in the package. Name
     the part (the claim comment, the repro report's environment
     record, the artifacts read against the issue's description, the
     repo-facts block) or a location from your
     references/evidence-guide.md. "The report" is not a source; "the
     output excerpt read against the error the issue describes" is.
   - Pass condition: a decision rule about the OUTCOME that someone
     else could apply and get your answer. Judge the thing itself (does
     the artifact show the issue's behavior?), never the write-up's
     shape (how many steps it has, how long it is, whether it uses a
     template's headings). Structure-shaped checks are what make
     graders disagree with themselves.
   - Weight: `required` (a fail here holds the package) or `preferred`
     (never changes the verdict).

2. A verdict rule below the table: how the check grades combine into
   accept (ready) or reject (hold), including how `unclear` is
   treated. The verdict space is binary. If you write no rule for
   `unclear`, the skill treats it as fail.

Cover what actually gets bad packages posted. The lecture named the
proof families: the environment is recorded, the steps are complete
and followable, the behavior shown matches the issue (not an adjacent
one), the outcome is stated honestly (an evidenced cannot-reproduce is
a pass, a confident wrong-target is not), and the words respect the
repo's conventions. A rubric that ignores a family will fail eval
packages designed around that family.

## Checks

| Check | Evidence | Pass condition | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment | Repro report: operating system, relevant program/runtime versions, and code state. Compare with the issue's target environment. | Pass if the environment used for reproduction is specific enough to recreate, and any important difference from the issue's environment is stated. | required |
| Backtrack | Repro report: setup, steps, exact commands/actions, and starting state. | Pass if a stranger can follow the steps from the stated starting point to the observed result without guessing a required command, input, or setup step. | required |
| Input_similarity | Issue description compared with the input, trigger, or scenario used in the reproduction. | Pass if the reproduction uses the same bug-triggering input as the issue, or an equivalent input that exercises the same condition. | required |
| Output_similarity | Pass if the observed behavior matches the issue's reported failure, or is an equivalent manifestation of the same failure. An honest cannot-reproduce also passes when the same trigger was attempted, the actual result is shown, and important environment differences are stated. A different or adjacent error presented as reproduction does not pass. | required |
| Evidence | Repro report artifacts: command output, logs, screenshots, stack traces, test results, and the report's conclusion. | Pass if the evidence supports exactly what the report claims. An evidenced cannot-reproduce passes when the attempted behavior and actual result are clearly shown; do not claim reproduction or root cause beyond the evidence. | required |
| Comms | Pass if the claim identifies the specific issue and honestly states the next investigation step, and the repro comment reports the student's own evidence while following all repo-specific posting, template, and disclosure rules. If the repository requires disclosure of AI assistance, a comment that omits that required disclosure fails. | required |


## Verdict rule

<!-- State how the grades above combine into accept or reject, and how
unclear is treated. Example shape (write your own): "accept if every
required check passes; preferred checks never change the verdict;
unclear counts as fail." -->

Accept when every applicable required check passes.

A failed or unclear required check means reject.

For a claim-only draft, reproduction checks that are not yet applicable do not affect the verdict. All checks that apply to the claim must pass.
